<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. The POS systems control various activities in the restaurant. By combining the data from your POS and payment processing systems, you gain insights into your best-selling products and which items to push back. While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs.</p>
<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees.

<p>One PayPal account for online and in store helps streamline your business operations—and you also have access to a diverse suite of other products and solutions. A restaurant's success depends on its ambiance, the quality of food, and the consistency of service. The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point. All the best features built into one easy-to-use Restaurant POS System.</p>

<p>Either one of these will help brick and mortar retailers switch to an easier to use and more affordable POS. The advanced POS system runs from an iPad or desktop computer and can integrate with Lightspeed's own ecommerce platform, additional apps and add-ons to enhance the in-store service - and of course the backend analytics and management functions. However, with hundreds of POS systems on the market, sifting through them to find the best solution for your business is overwhelming.</p>

With the roll-out of its Inventory 2.0 function, Lavu has addressed arguably its biggest deficit and its inventory management and purchasing ordering features are now on par with those of other top-rated systems. This offers a seamless experience to your customers and makes life easier for staff.</p>
<p>Vend tracks every sale in real time, which allows us to view overall sales throughout the day or week. As a case in point, some self-ordering systems not requiring staff assistance may not properly recognize a subsequent order from the same customer at a table. For large retail stores or chain of stores, none of the changes are done locally. A complete restaurant management system that begins with taking the guest order and ends with billing and tax reports.</p>
