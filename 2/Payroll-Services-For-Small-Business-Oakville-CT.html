<p>Make sure to see how the management and reporting features actually work before you pay any money. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation. As the store plays a larger role, it's time for point of sale (POS) to expand its role, too. These provide retailers with tools ranging from order management and inventory tracking to customer management and payment processing for more seamless transactions.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>

A sleek POS can also give your business a modern, professional feel that may impress customers.
