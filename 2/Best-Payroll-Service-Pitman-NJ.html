<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server. In addition, you can use them with back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors Many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) are using these types of cloud-enabled POS services without the need to keep a physical back-end server in multiple locations.</p>
<p>The accurate records of sales and inventory will help you determine which products are selling and which are not. POS systems have three parts: software, hardware and a credit card processor. A basic ‘starter' bundle will cost around £1,795 and includes the bar POS software along with a touchscreen PC, cash drawer, receipt printer, and card reader.

Table service and fly-by service order entry, cashier financial accountability, and staff communications.</p>

We focused our products on two vertical markets; Computer Service & Retail Point of Sales and Restaurant Point of Sales. Some systems offer functionality which is close to that offered by CMS packages; for example, sending emails to customers to thank them for sales, advertise bargains or offer coupons, and offer other loyalty perks.</p>
<p>A&B POS is a full-featured point-of-sale solution that provides simple but powerful functionalities in terms of taking orders, providing discounts and tips, managing inventory, and generating daily reports for insights on your business. As you can imagine this wasn't the most efficient way of doing things, especially for small businesses low in staff members who would rely on only a handful of people to keep track of stock, pricing, orders, etc… Luckily for us, we live in the 21st century where Point of Sale software has now been around for decades.</p>

In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package.

Flexible, affordable and serviceable are the key functions that aptly describe our mPOS Point of sale software system.</p>

Pro shops, as well as any retail business will benefit from TallySales.

Win back churned customers and increase customer lifetime value with in-built loyalty that tracks all customer contacts and purchasing preferences; launch targeted promotions, offers, and personalized campaigns that keep customers coming back. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
