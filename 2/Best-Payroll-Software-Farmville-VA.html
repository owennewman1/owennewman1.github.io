<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>As well, POS software can be integrated into other applications so that all areas of business management can be viewed in one central place. Point of Sale System helps the retailers to manage their physical stores with ease. A major consideration is that of electronic payment clearance, so that the shop can take credit cards and debit cards along with cash. Information on the workload per hour allows for efficient management of your staff.</p>
<p>Designed for food service businesses and restaurants, this cloud-based restaurant and catering management solution manages inventories and recipes. We use livepos and this helps in simplifying our sales report every day and its accurate compared to the old fashioned cash registers. Lessen the rush at bar by letting customers order drinks directly from the app. For instance, if you own a retail store, you need a retail POS system.</p>

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it. Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>
<p>Fortunately, almost every type of card reader can take magstripe payments.

This includes the ability to add and remove registers with ease, eCommerce, customer management, email marketing, integrated accounting, gift cards, and customer loyalty programs. Hopefully, this article has given you what you need to make an informed decision about the POS system you will choose for your retail business.</p>
