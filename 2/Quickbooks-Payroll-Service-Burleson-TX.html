<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>In order to use the bar POS software you will need hardware. With LS One you can take cash, cards, foreign currency, gift cards, credit memos and loyalty points as methods of payment. Designed for restaurants, cafes, and bars-really any business with a menu-TouchBistro is a successful Point of Sale application that runs solely on mobile iPads that are synchronized through a local network. Electronic POS software systems streamline retail operations by automating the transaction process and tracking important sales data.</p>
