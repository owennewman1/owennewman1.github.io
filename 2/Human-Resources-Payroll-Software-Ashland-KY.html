Most POS providers will list the pieces of POS hardware that their software is compatible with. To help you select the best restaurant POS system for your business, we have reviewed some of the most popular EPOS systems for bars and restaurants in the UK today.</p>
<p>With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Let's now look at the things to consider before buying any restaurant management software for your business. If your business relies heavily on return business, then opting for a point of sale that offers this feature could seriously up your customer return rate.

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
