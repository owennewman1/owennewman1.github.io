You may think of this as a mobile register that may be moved to wherever the customers are, only that it offers more capabilities than a conventional cash register.

<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch.
