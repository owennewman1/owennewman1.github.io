<p>RETAILvantage POS Retail systems will keep your customers satisfied and provide you with powerful analysis of what is truly selling. Once you have it installed it can take a little bit of time getting your items, customers, and employees into the system. Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb. Since the system works through handheld devices connected to a main POS server, potential errors and omissions in the manual order taking process of the traditional point of sale restaurant are eliminated.</p>
