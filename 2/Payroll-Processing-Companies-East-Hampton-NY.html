<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>It used to be that as a small-business owner, you had just a few ways to accept payments from your customers. Recently purchased by Upserve, the low-cost, user-friendly Upserve caters to bars, clubs, and restaurants. The POS hardware includes an internet-enabled device that can run the POS software, plus transaction tools like a receipt printer and a cash drawer. Brick and mortar retailers are moving toward leaner systems that operate on tablets and smartphones, not complicated systems that cost thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The POS system makes it a good fit for new businesses or businesses with little to no point-of-sale experience. Track your sales, inventory, employees and customers - everything you need to know in one place. Two robust sets of tools are offered - a free Square POS for credit card processing and tracking sales, and the Square for Retail with intelligent and integrated tools purpose-built for more complex retail businesses.</p>

<p>Credit card reader: Since the EMV payment standard went live in 2015 , secure and EMV-compliant credit card readers are a must-have. Also, you'll want to train your staff on important features like upselling, inventory management, and end of day reports, all from the POS itself. Mobile technology has untethered the payment process from the traditional register, turning the entire store into a POS via tablets and other devices.</p>

<p>Basic point of sale systems currently in use include standalone electronic cash registers, also known as ECRs; ECR-based network systems; and controller-based systems.

The software features advanced caller ID integration to easily manage incoming calls.</p>

You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, then using Shopify POS for in-store transactions is a no-brainer.
