This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. Lavu is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as an intelligent combination of cloud computing, wireless technologies, and a sleek touchscreen interface for restaurant. Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>
<p>Point of sale (POS) machine is an electronic system that provides business with capability to retain and analyze a wide variety of data on a continuous basis which also gives the transaction information associated with consumer purchasing detail. They can integrate with mobile devices and cloud services and satisfy the software and hardware requirements of users. Those of us of a certain age who worked in retail or food service may remember the days before modern point of sale (POS) systems.</p>

Retail management software typically includes: Point of Sale (POS), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Sales Order Management, Inventory Management, Purchasing & Receiving, Reporting and data driven Dashboard applications. With the internet boom and consumers adopting smartphones at an explosive rate, a host of new POS functionalities and features have emerged to help independent retailers offer the connected, omnichannel shopping experience that consumers love.</p>

You can take orders, manage tables and reservations, split checks, and accept payments with it. It manages inventory at the ingredient level, and its purchase-ordering system can automatically reorder supplies.</p>
