<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Check inventory on the fly, assist customers with purchase decisions, and complete transactions — at the counter or out on the sales floor. Square charges a minimal percentage for every tap, dip, or swipe (representing your customer's payment via credit card or mobile device) in your POS device (tablet or smartphone with Square magstripe reader or POS terminal with Square contactless reader). The potential for huge profits, additional sales and repeat customers are the overwhelming reasons to sell gift cards.</p>
<p>Dinlr Waiter is a POS system for restaurants that runs on iPads and iPhones. Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal. Card payment starts by swiping the card - through MSR or a handheld device then taking customer's authorization for the specified amount. Restaurant POS systems should be easy to use, reliable, and cost-effective. In the following comparison chart, we chose to review the top 20 providers instead of our original list of top 10 restaurant POS systems.</p>

For example, ShopKeep and TouchBistro build their systems around food and beverage businesses like quick-service restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions. The best bar point of sale system will also integrate tableside ordering and act as a mobile POS system.</p>
<p>Customers can purchase products online and pick them up at their preferred store outlets, they can order products not available in stores and have them shipped directly, and they can also return a product at the store or have it collected from the desired location, irrespective of the channel of purchase.

Working with leading merchant providers from around the world, Vend allows businesses to choose the best way to accept payments, including debit, credit and gift cards.</p>

<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
