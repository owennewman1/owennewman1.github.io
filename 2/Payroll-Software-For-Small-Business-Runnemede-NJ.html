The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system has a solid customer information system, which comes in handy when you need to maintain conversations with your customers, as well as promote the business through loyalty programs like gift cards. Infor POS helps operators in hotels, food services, restaurants, and other hospitality organizations control incoming data from multiple revenue centers.
