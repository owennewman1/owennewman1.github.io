Employee Management: Many POS systems come with built-in time card functionality and the ability to manage your employees' hours. And by letting your staff take an order just as easily at a table as at a cash point, you can dramatically increase speed of service, which is important at any time of day, but especially so when customers are on a time deadline, such as at lunchtime.</p>
