<p>A point of sale system is a type of computer or specialized terminal that is used to instantly record a transaction. Loyverse is suited for retail stores, salons, restaurants and cafes. Inventory management is a key omnichannel challenge and accurate allocation and replenishment are critical to customer satisfaction. Some POS software providers have proprietary POS hardware that you're required to use, while some providers let you use third-party hardware components. POSitouch offers a premium software suite with the features and functionality to support restaurants of all sizes, from independent locations to the biggest national chains.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
