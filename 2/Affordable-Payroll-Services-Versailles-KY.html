<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Indeed, these systems are often well suited for small businesses because they are the least expensive of the POS system options, they nonetheless provide many helpful features, including automatic sales and tax calculation ability; calculation of change owed to the customer; sales report generation capability; capacity to sort food stamps and trading stamps (through programming of function keys); and scanning.</p>
<p>Restaurants process high volumes of credit card transactions and cash daily, making a restaurant software necessary. We provide powerful Management Systems, including POS hardware and POS software, Inventory and eCommerce solutions based on Client needs using the latest leading-edge technology. The starter plan is best suited for cafes, standard plan is good for fast casual restaurants, and pro plan is best for full-service restaurants.</p>
<p>With the right software you would be able to simplify managing aspects, automate tedious tasks and finally efficiency and speed in customer services, which would result in a better business and increase your profits. Luckily, restaurant POS software makes it easy to create an online ordering portal with minimal effort on your part.

<p>Firstly, CAKE caters to full-service and quick-service restaurants, pubs, bars, and other food businesses. Credit and debit card transactions are now more common than cash payments POS systems make card processing fast, easy, and secure. A quick glance at a shopper's purchase history (or all those customer details you've started collecting!) in Retail Pro can equip your sales associates with the information they need to determine what products your customer would find most interesting and relevant, and make the offer for an upsell when they're in the store.</p>
<p>This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. A proper POS system can streamline your retail outlet & saves time, a flawed one can complicate even the little things, thus making the process of checkout frustrating for anyone at the payment counter. It is a good idea to talk to your employees and your customers to get feedback on what kinds of features would help. Not all Point of Sale (POS) solutions are the same, and each business needs slightly different features when choosing a POS machine.</p>

<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it. Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost.

<p>Many times it will have the MSR built in. Many large stores use mechanical keyboards which are rated for higher use than a standard consumer keyboard. Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. A cloud-based restaurant POS does both by providing an efficient system to modify menus and prices.
