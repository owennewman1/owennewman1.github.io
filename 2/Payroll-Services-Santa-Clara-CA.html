<p>Here, it's essential to know that when your customers use a restaurant reservation system to book tables, you will be able to host them better. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.
