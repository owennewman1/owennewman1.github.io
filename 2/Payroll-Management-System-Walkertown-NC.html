<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>

<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye.

<p>Although each business is unique, the typical POS hardware you need for your retail business includes a tablet and stand, cash drawer, barcode scanner, and receipt printer. To evolve into a valuable component of Retail 4.0, POS systems will need IoT connectivity.
