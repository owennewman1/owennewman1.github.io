<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business. As you can see, there are many options and features to consider when it comes to retail POS technology. With an integration to your onsite property management system from the POS, you can charge restaurant checks directly to the room for billing.</p>
<p>Reporting is also a paramount consideration, so when it comes to selecting a retail management software, you'll want customized reporting with detailed customer reporting, sales reports, vendor reporting, and inventory stock levels. POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.</p>
