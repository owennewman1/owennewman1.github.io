<p>Point of sale systems are revolutionizing the retail and hospitality industry. Enable your retail employees with a modern web and cloud point of sale system to deliver excellent customer service everywhere in the store. Detailed sales reports can be printed by region and by store or groups of staff within stores. It's crucial for your POS system to integrate easily with inventory systems, payment processing platforms, loyalty programs, reservation systems, CRM systems, shift scheduling systems, and other such tech platforms.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>
<p>Cashier Live bills itself as smart online POS software for retailers. It allows you to centralize your inventory, sales, and reports on a single SEO-optimized back-end with built-in mobile capability. Lightspeed POS allows you to set up customer profiles for purchase history and lifetime value.

This will enable them to drive inventory management, supply chain management, and customer relationship management apart from generating big data analytics that retailers can use for targeted marketing and sales campaigns. Cloud-based POS also helps to expand POS systems in addition to computers to mobile and tablet devices.</p>
<p>All modern POS systems have a frontend interface for the point of sale and a backend (sometimes called ‘backoffice' or ‘dashboard') side for behind-the-scenes analytics and management functions. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this. You can easily accept cash payments as well as use credit cards, debit cards, etc. The companies and businesses get hold of commerce by making use of point of sale systems that helps in promoting longevity in the business.</p>

<p>Mobile POS systems are gaining popularity in some customer-facing industries. While the chances of a disaster, theft, or malfunction happening to those hard drives seems slim; it has hit businesses at the worst times. Once you've come up with a shortlist of potential POS systems, check out what businesses like yours are saying about them. The OrderUp Self-Order Kiosk app is designed to increase ticket size by at least 20% at table and counter service restaurants.</p>
<p>For example, having your inventory data visibility across stores means when your store is out of stock on a particular product, sales associates can check its availability at other locations.

A lot of new businesses adopting this software and running their business successfully. Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software.</p>
<p>Menu, inventory and layout management are included in the basic restaurant software package, though add-ons are also available (more on that below). In some industries, mobile apps might replace some popular uses such as check-ins and product look-up or even ticket sales. Supports multiple payment options, improves staff management, and streamlines payroll and accounting procedures.
