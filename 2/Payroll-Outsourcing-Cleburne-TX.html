<p>Proactive retailers are constantly striving to increase visibility into exactly who their customers are, how they're interacting with your stores, and what they want. With the increase in complexity of data, retailers usually do not get time to maintain sales performance analysis, category analysis and inventories. Many POS systems are software suites that include sale, inventory, stock counting, vendor ordering, customer loyalty and reporting modules.</p>
