Tillpoint is the multi-award-winning POS & Restaurant Management System. Mobile POS is now available that keeps POS users from being tied down to a specific location in a store.</p>
<p>This type of software can be easily installed on your POS terminal or tablet and has a wide range of capabilities - a notable one being the ability for you to store and view your sales data online. Remember that, like most other business solutions, a POS system should be able to reliably and efficiently address your retail business requirements. Apart from order management, restaurant table management, payment handling, inventory management, employee management, and menu management, it comes with CRM capabilities- all of which we've repeatedly tried, tested and confirmed that they indeed perform well.</p>

<p>With Shopify POS, you can manage all of your in-store and online selling in one place. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.
