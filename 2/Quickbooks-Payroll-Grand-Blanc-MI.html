<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Cloud-based POS platform that lets restaurants facilitate workflow processes with inventory tracking, guest management and more. Data analytics are a dynamic part of modern POS systems. And while features like loyalty or marketing may not even be on your radar, you may find that implementing the tools that come with your chosen POS can significantly increase sales. Handheld scanners and wireless scanners have increased efficiency levels at point of sale to a large extent, and customers no longer have to queue up for many minutes while the cashier checks out their items one by one and comes up with the bill in a long and laborious process.</p>
<p>Cloud-based systems can greatly reduce the upfront costs of implementing a POS system for many businesses. So, of course, you should expect Square for Restaurants to provide some of the best payment handling features for restaurant POS systems.
