<p>If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise. For newer, smaller businesses, you may not need advanced and expensive POS system reporting features. Access the details for every reservation in the calendar to check the date, time, and notes on customers' preferences or their pre-order.</p>
