<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Not only this, customers can avail the software's loyalty features to collect points and redeem these when needed. The POS System is hardware which is combined with POS software and peripheral devices. Additionally, the staff will have an easy time locating the various tabs whenever they need to close them. It is used by various types of retail businesses selling different products like mobile devices, clothing, beauty, cosmetics, books, sports apparel, and even groceries.</p>
