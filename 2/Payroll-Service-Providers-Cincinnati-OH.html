<p>A point of sale system is a type of computer or specialized terminal that is used to instantly record a transaction. Loyverse is suited for retail stores, salons, restaurants and cafes. Inventory management is a key omnichannel challenge and accurate allocation and replenishment are critical to customer satisfaction. Some POS software providers have proprietary POS hardware that you're required to use, while some providers let you use third-party hardware components. POSitouch offers a premium software suite with the features and functionality to support restaurants of all sizes, from independent locations to the biggest national chains.</p>
