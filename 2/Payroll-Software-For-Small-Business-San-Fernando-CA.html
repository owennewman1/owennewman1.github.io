<p>A single POS terminal may be enough for small and new businesses, but you may want to add more if your business is busy and you need to reduce wait times.

You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
