<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. All function essentially as sales and cash management tools, but each has features that are unique. In essence, they are built to help you with inventory management, order management, customer management, table management, credit card processing, menu management, employee management, and remote real-time tracking of all the KPIs plus cash flow.</p>
<p>Most companies are constantly updating their product and adding features while still keeping costs affordable Even some of the free POS apps provide basic inventory and a handful of integrations. For example, POS system makes it easier to keep track of your inventory, to notice and analyze movements and tendencies in sales processes, to analyze your sales reports and other data in order to predict more precisely future trend and your company's requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard restaurant-centric features, it offers many useful features specific to bars. Refunds and store credit can be offered and Shopify allows for pretty much any payment option you can think of. Imonggo is a retail POS system with a free plan for startups and very small businesses, specifically those with fewer than 1,000 inventory items that sell 1,000 products or fewer per month. Besides just cash registers, when people are discussing POS systems, they're referring to the software itself, which can be cloud-based or client-based.</p>

<p>With real-time inventory tracking, retailers can trust that their inventory levels—both online and in their brick-and-mortar store—are accurate.

Built specifically for restaurants, Toast brings together many solutions from integrated online ordering and loyalty programs to payroll and labor and sales reporting, all on a mobile, cloud-based POS system.</p>

<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers.
