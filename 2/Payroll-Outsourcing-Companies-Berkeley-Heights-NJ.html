Bottom Line: A solid point-of-sale (POS) system for small to midsize businesses (SMBs), Revel Systems POS has a simple UI and many useful features. However, there are five needs common among all restaurants, whether they are full-service dining or fast food counters.</p>
<p>Basic point of sale systems currently in use include standalone electronic cash registers, also known as ECRs; ECR-based network systems; and controller-based systems. Cloud-based POS systems are different from traditional POS largely because user data, including sales and inventory, are not stored locally, but in a remote server. The software features advanced caller ID integration to easily manage incoming calls.</p>
<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
