<p>Updating your point of sale (POS) systems can help you to provide better customer service, increase your stock control, increase staff efficiency, reduce theft at the point of sale, and provide customers with more information. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system has a solid customer information system, which comes in handy when you need to maintain conversations with your customers, as well as promote the business through loyalty programs like gift cards. Infor POS helps operators in hotels, food services, restaurants, and other hospitality organizations control incoming data from multiple revenue centers. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers.</p>
<p>EMV is the standard that is said to provide more security than the swipe-and-sign tech we've been using for the past decade or so. The ability to "dip" these cards means additional or new hardware for which some POS systems charge a bit extra. Affordable, easy to use, feature rich, and 100% multi-lingual restaurant point of sale and store management solution. At a time when computers were becoming commonplace, POS vendors had to adapt their software to maximise its potential.</p>
<p>Linga POS is an iPad POS system for restaurants from Benseron Hospitality. When it come to the actual POS hardware, you need to make sure it is compatible with the software, and that the various pieces of hardware such as the barcode scanner, cash register, and credit card reader, are compatible. Franpos, formerly iConnect, is a cloud-based franchise POS system that works with businesses in the beauty, retail and quick-service restaurant industries.</p>

Many POS systems are software suites that include sale, inventory, stock counting, vendor ordering, customer loyalty and reporting modules.</p>

<p>As well as actually allowing the customer to purchase goods, POS systems allow the business operator to do nearly everything from ordering and purchasing stock to generating reports on sales. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>

While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
<p>While Rezku may not have as many robust features as other POS software, it still gives an impressive showing. In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package. This should mean a terminal that is fast, easy to understand and quick to respond to the touch of the server, cashier or bar tender. Flexible, affordable and serviceable are the key functions that aptly describe our mPOS Point of sale software system.</p>
<p>Rezku's team is staffed with experts in restaurant management technology that want you to succeed.
