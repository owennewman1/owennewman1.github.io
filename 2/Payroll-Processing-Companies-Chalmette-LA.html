<p>Store owners, especially in these hard times, have to watch their pennies when investing in Point of Sale (POS) hardware. Considering all that, it's not hard to see why pos terminals can be found in restaurants, hotels, bars, shops, stores, malls. With customer relationship management, maintain customer loyalty programs, issue gift cards, maintain customer data and add comments and notes. TouchBistro is one of the few restaurant POS systems that have not only perfected the basic POS functionalities, but also gone beyond them to offer exclusive, out-of-the-box extras.</p>
<p>EMV is the standard that is said to provide more security than the swipe-and-sign tech we've been using for the past decade or so. The ability to "dip" these cards means additional or new hardware for which some POS systems charge a bit extra. Affordable, easy to use, feature rich, and 100% multi-lingual restaurant point of sale and store management solution. At a time when computers were becoming commonplace, POS vendors had to adapt their software to maximise its potential.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>
