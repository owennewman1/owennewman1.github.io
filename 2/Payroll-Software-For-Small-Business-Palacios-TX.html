<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Double check that the POS is able to accept chip-enabled credit and debit cards. Now whether you refer to it as a POS system or retail management system - it will do the same. And with our custom-made software, you can make sure you offer your customers the best service and gain additional customer loyalty points. While some systems can handle the POS of both restaurants and retail businesses, many systems are designed specifically to handle the demanding needs of the latter.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard restaurant-centric features, it offers many useful features specific to bars. Refunds and store credit can be offered and Shopify allows for pretty much any payment option you can think of. Imonggo is a retail POS system with a free plan for startups and very small businesses, specifically those with fewer than 1,000 inventory items that sell 1,000 products or fewer per month. Besides just cash registers, when people are discussing POS systems, they're referring to the software itself, which can be cloud-based or client-based.</p>
