<p>Any retail store that wants to stay in business for a long time will appreciate every customer that walks through the front door; the question is whether or not they will choose to display that appreciation. At the same time updating between multiple stations and the back end administrative computer should be capable of being efficiently performed, so that on one hand either at the start of the day or at any time each station will have the latest inventory to process all items for sale, while on the other hand at the end of the day the back end administrative computer can be updated in terms of all sale records.</p>

POSGuys offers a wide range of products for retailers, restaurants and salons. The mobile POS can be used to serve customers everywhere - alternatively, there is a self-order menu that lets customers order by themselves on an iPad at their table. Yet, because the CRM database is integrated with the POS software, the information stored in the database is even more valuable.</p>
<p>Touch screen systems designed for restaurants, bars, cafes and anyplace that sales food to customers.

Payment is easy - at the beginning of the night, servers can start a tab in the POS for each customer, adding their name and payment card information so they don't have to ask again, allowing customers more convenience when they spend an evening in your bar.</p>

Multichannel Customer Experience — retailers who manage online stores along with physical stores should have the option in their POS system to provide the same consistent product and pricing information to their customers, whether online or onsite.</p>

<p>Before choosing from the many great POS systems for restaurants and bars , evaluate your business's needs and assess how each option fulfills those needs. A POS transaction is the moment where a transaction is finalized or the moment where a customer tenders payment in exchange for goods and services. With customer resource management (CRM) solutions, restaurateurs can use customer data to deploy email marketing and influence loyalty programs, and online ordering.</p>
<p>The number one reason customers get unhappy with a retail store is a long queue at the check-out. There are so many restaurants out there who offer the home delivery feature for their customers. Square POS also sells Square Stand, an iPad contactless and chip stand that allows contactless payments as well as chip cards, NFC and magstripe. A feature-rich POS software provides a huge range of capabilities such as billing and order processing, sales monitoring and reporting, inventory tracking, returns, analytics, mobile connectivity, customer data management, employee management, and loyalty programs.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
