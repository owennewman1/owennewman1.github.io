For retailers, only Cumulus Retail offers a simple solution with the power to scale to a national enterprise network of stores over time.

<p>Advanced POS reporting notifies managers of employee or customer theft, shows menu and liquor sales trends over time, and analyzes customer data with built-in CRM. The basic function of a restaurant point of sale system is to facilitate customer orders and accept payment.
