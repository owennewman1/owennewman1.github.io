<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Set up custom buttons to accept cash, checks, gift cards or any payment type you want. As guest management and POS system, Cake POS offers online and offline functions with an integrated hardware package. When selecting a retail POS solution, consider the type of hardware you want to use and what will be the most practical for your store. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
