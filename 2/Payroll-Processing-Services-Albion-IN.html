Both the retail and restaurant versions of its POS software have a rich assortment of back-office tools to help you manage your business, with inventory, purchase ordering, reporting and CRM features. One such function includes the synergies, which are created by assimilating them with different kinds of back-end applications like inventory management and customer relationship management ( CRM ).</p>

<p>Small restaurant businesses like cafes, pizzerias, nightclubs and bars can capitalize on the software's advanced menu creation and table mapping capabilities, while large franchises would be more interested in taking advantage of its real-time multi-location data syncing. Epos Now POS comes as a complete system used in the hospitality, including restaurants, and retail industries. For retail businesses, inventory is carefully monitored and set to automatically replenish diminished inventory.</p>

Cash registers are not as evolved as using a POS system and lack many of the functions and features of a modern day point of sale system like Square Point of Sale A cash register could be considered a point of sale solution technically, however, for our definitions, we will be focusing on point-of-sale machines (aka POS terminals) that involve both software and hardware.</p>
