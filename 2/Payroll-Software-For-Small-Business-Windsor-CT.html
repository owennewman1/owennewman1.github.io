<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? Web-based solution that provides restaurant POS through credit card integration, automation, call center and more. You manage your inventory and order at two places and you have to keep an eye on your stock every time a sale is made. You'll also have access to the ShopKeep mobile app, where you can view real-time sales information, inventory, and data from anywhere on the go. This makes it easy for you to keep an eye on your business even when you're not physically present on location.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>POS software is installed at the very place the main transaction occurs at a retail store. Talech has a large how-to library and experienced customer support to help most restaurants quickly get the essentials operational.
