<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>

<p>The platform comes equipped with a robust inventory management feature allowing you to customize categories and settings. Reporting: Most POS systems will also come with some form of base reporting If you're a smaller business or one that doesn't plan to rely on analytics much, you may be perfectly happy with a system with just a handful of basic reports. With inventory management, you can change menu details, like name, quantity, and price, in real-time.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>Many POS systems are tailor-made and marketed to specific types of businesses, especially full-service restaurants or retail. Modern restaurant POS systems provide a platform that sits at the heart of any food and beverage operation, large or small, helping to enhance the customer experience and streamline business operations. Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list.</p>
