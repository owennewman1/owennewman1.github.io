<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>Newer technology services on the market like cloud-based and hybrid point of sale solutions run on iPads and tablets where your data is synced and stored online and eliminates the need for an on-premise server like with legacy software and hardware. Focus POS systems are PCI-compliant; easy to use, install and maintain; and deliver return on investment by maximizing operational efficiency and minimizing costs.</p>

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>Mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) systems are also a consideration for small businesses and growing retailers. Manage tabs and staff, customize orders, tie split inventory to every sale, and track tips. The system also offers restaurant management tools to help you run the main aspects of your operations from a single platform.

The great thing about choosing a POS company that provides both types of hardware is that you always have multiple options to find the right hardware to match your unique business setup.</p>

They are best suited for retail stores that have cash dedicated cash wraps. You can connect any additional hardware to the POS system and use receipt printers, cash drawers, kitchen ticket printers or display systems, barcode scanners, etc.</p>

SWIM offers four different pricing structures, starting with a month of trialling the software to the highest plan that includes unlimited sales and inventory items.

<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
