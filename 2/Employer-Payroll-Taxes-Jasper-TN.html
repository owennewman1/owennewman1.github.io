Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere.

Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork. The primary differences between Quick Service and Full Service POS systems can be found in the software and hardware specifications.</p>
