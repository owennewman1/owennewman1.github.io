Retail and gaming POS solution that offers employee access controls, inventory tracking, check splitting, and loyalty cards. Our POS terminals speed up your daily operations and enhance your customer service by automatically calculating offers, promotion prices and special prices for loyal customers. TouchSystems understands that reality and helps people to discover those tools, whether they be self-service kiosks, digital signage or point of sale (POS) terminals.</p>
<p>From inventory tracking to detailed reports and integrations with other business management tools, point of sale software should adapt to your business needs — not the other way around. Suitable for omni-channel retailers and wholesalers, Cin7 integrates cloud inventory, Point of Sale, warehouse management, B2B ecommerce, 3PL, and direct EDI, in one robust platform. While point of sale systems come in many shapes, sizes, and price tags, we are only going to focus on one type of POS system in this article.</p>

Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.
