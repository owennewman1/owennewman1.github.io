<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. All types of restaurants and bars match process flow to AccuPOS' adaptive system with touch screen, PC, handheld, and tablet. ShopKeep's inventory management module, while made for retailers, does a great job of managing restaurant inventory. To keep the service and guest experience seamless, you need a nightclub or bar POS system that can keep up with the rush. The POS hardware you need for your bar will typically include a tablet, tablet stand, receipt printer, cash drawer, and credit card terminal or card reader.</p>
<p>Features include inventory management, sales analytics, digital receipts and loyalty programs. Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.</p>
<p>The advantage to businesses that provide a unified commerce experience to their customers is that omnichannel customers spend more than single-channel customers. Many POS systems allow you to customize your receipts with your business's logo or to go paperless by sending a digital receipt or giving the option for no receipt. As well as being able to track customer purchases over time, Booker allows you to connect your POS with customer profiles to process payments using a card on file for incredible fast and efficient transactions.</p>
