<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before taking advantage of these long-term discounts, you should be confident that you like the software enough and will still be in business for that length of time, because there are usually no refunds. As with all POS systems, owners can track sales, deliveries, inventory, employee schedules, and payroll. Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. POS software records each sale when it happens, so your inventory records are always up-to-date.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>For example, department stores often have POSs for individual product groups, such as appliances, electronics, and apparel. The speed at which point of sale (POS) software is evolving is significant. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
