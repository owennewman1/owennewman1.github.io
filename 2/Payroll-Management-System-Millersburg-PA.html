<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. With Mink Foodiee in-depth reporting and analytics, view real-time reports from anywhere, anytime, and make quick data-driven decisions for your restaurant. We provide custom configured systems with computer hardware and software, all ready to plug and play. POS systems have been touted as valuable tools for a wide variety of business purposes, including refining target marketing strategies; tracking supplier purchases; determining customer purchasing patterns; analyzing sales (on a daily, monthly, or annual basis) of each inventory item, department, or supplier; and creating reports for use in making purchases, reorders, etc.</p>
<p>IVend POS also helps combat in-store fraud by assigning access rights per salesperson with security, Biometric login, as well as to management of data access restrictions with password, and automatic alerts on suspicious behaviors. Most restaurant POS solutions have reporting features built-in to monitor your transactions by date, time, and type. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Vend POS is a highly flexible and mobile point-of-sale (POS) system that, while it lacks a few advanced features and charges extra for phone support, is an excellent choice for small businesses. Regardless if you're operating a small shop or a restaurant, you would want automation to be on your side when managing sales transactions. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you'll shape inventory to meet customer needs, and find ways to improve the bottom line.</p>

<p>APIs These connections are enabled by API-led connectivity , an integration approach that connects these systems through modern, managed APIs by exposing the underlying data. Toast allows for good inventory management in real-time, letting your bartenders make changes to the menu when they've run out of an item to mix a drink.
