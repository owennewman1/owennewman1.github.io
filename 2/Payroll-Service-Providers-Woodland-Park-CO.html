NCR Silver aims its point-of-sale solution at both small and larger businesses with hooks to enterprise-class back-ends and a wide variety of hardware options.

Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>

The many benefits of point of sale systems make it an essential business investment.</p>
<p>From the fast interface to quick checkouts, quality report, easy menu configuration setup, table management and a lot more, it takes care of everything depending on your restaurant business requirements.
