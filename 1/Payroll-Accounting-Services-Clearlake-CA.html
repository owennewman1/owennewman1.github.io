<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection. Whether you own a small boutique with a handful of SKUs or a variety store with thousands of products, one thing is for sure; if you don't have the right inventory balance, you're missing out on sales and killing your cash flow. Inventory Management: Save your time and money while updating inventories.</p>
<p>Restaurant point of sale systems cost any from the price of a daily cup of coffee to a daily surf-n-turf dinner. Having a POS system that accepts several types of payments establishes credibility with customers as soon as they walk in your store. Designed for an iPAD, this POS assists jewellers with sales processing and the management of their business. Comcash offers cloud-based POS software for retailers and a mobile POS app for the iPhone and iPod Touch that can be used as a line buster in retail stores or to take orders tableside in restaurants.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers.

<p>A lot of general POS systems bill themselves as suitable for use in a restaurant. While the software powering a restaurant POS is the main element of a POS system, hardware is important as well. Some mobile POS systems allow the server to place orders right at the table, saving on time and reducing the chances of making a mistake.
