<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>There is POS software specific to almost every kind of business imaginable - hotels, retail, restaurant, auto mechanic, etc. See how easy it can be to use an integrated POS system and accounting software with the SumUp card reader and Debitoor connection. Refund the past orders to gift cards, store credit or back to the customer by using the original payment method. Traditionally, businesses set up POSs near store exits to increase the rate of impulse purchases as customers leave.</p>

<p>Among the most common inventory management features available in POS software are reminders to inform you when stock of a certain product is running low. Vend is mobile, so you can take your point of sale system onto the shop floor, beat the queues and build personal engagement with your customers. POS once referred only to the site—typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services.</p>
<p>The Revel POS is designed to be a full restaurant POS system, managing finance and accounting in addition to sales, inventory, and staff. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions. Most restaurants that have iPad self-order menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order.</p>
<p>Lightspeed allows restaurants to easily build and update menus, adjust floor plans in real time and update stock inventory. When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.</p>
