<p>When choosing a retail store for shopping needs, shoppers choose where to go based on a number of factors. Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software.
