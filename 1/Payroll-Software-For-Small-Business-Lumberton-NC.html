<p>Not every restaurant POS system is equal, and even a POS that offers all the right features might not be right for your specific business.

<p>Scheduling employees and staying on top of their hours is possible from the POS too, and our POS can be integrated with your payroll management software.

These features can also help manage those customers and page them when work has been completed.</p>
<p>As well as actually allowing the customer to purchase goods, POS systems allow the business operator to do nearly everything from ordering and purchasing stock to generating reports on sales. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>
