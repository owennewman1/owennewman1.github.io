<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>As a business owner, use Yelp to communicate with your customers and text them directly. It's predicted that eighty percent of all enterprise (and mission-critical) workloads will move to the cloud by 2025 ( Top 10 Cloud Predictions ). To this end, many retailers are seeking a cloud-based strategy to meet employee and customer needs. Our tailor-made menu layouts, buttons, and graphics are all designed around your business and set up with the specific user in mind, whether it's management, service staff, or your customer.</p>
<p>The advantage to businesses that provide a unified commerce experience to their customers is that omnichannel customers spend more than single-channel customers. Many POS systems allow you to customize your receipts with your business's logo or to go paperless by sending a digital receipt or giving the option for no receipt. As well as being able to track customer purchases over time, Booker allows you to connect your POS with customer profiles to process payments using a card on file for incredible fast and efficient transactions.</p>

These features can also help manage those customers and page them when work has been completed.</p>
<p>As well as actually allowing the customer to purchase goods, POS systems allow the business operator to do nearly everything from ordering and purchasing stock to generating reports on sales. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>
<p>Keep all the stores linked up by sharing customers, gift cards, stock and more. You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen. POS hardware can be a stationary terminal or a mobile device, such as a tablet or iPad. For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards.</p>
