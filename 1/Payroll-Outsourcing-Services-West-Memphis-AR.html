<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. 4. POS Software - Again this would seem obvious, but many all-in-one POS systems simply consist of an empty hardware shell with nothing running on it. Likewise, an all-in-one printer would not scan, fax, or print without software driving features. Some systems offer both inventory control and accounting modules but most successful retailers use completely different systems for each one. Sales Reporting: On the surface, most POS systems enable you to look at your sales.</p>
<p>Mobile features use apps or mobile-friendly websites to allow customers to place orders or make purchases remotely using their phones, tablets or computers. TouchSuite offers multiple POS systems and business services, including credit card processing.

<p>The highly functional software ensures better table and menu management, inventory management, and portable operations with portable app reporting. It can make a real difference to how much time you spend on processing sales, replenishing stock and even training your staff. The software in some systems runs only for a limited period of time.
