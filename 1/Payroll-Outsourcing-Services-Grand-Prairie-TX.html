<p>Point of sale systems are revolutionizing the retail and hospitality industry. Enable your retail employees with a modern web and cloud point of sale system to deliver excellent customer service everywhere in the store. Detailed sales reports can be printed by region and by store or groups of staff within stores. It's crucial for your POS system to integrate easily with inventory systems, payment processing platforms, loyalty programs, reservation systems, CRM systems, shift scheduling systems, and other such tech platforms.</p>

Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>
