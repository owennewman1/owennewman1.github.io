But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>Other businesses who launched pre-2000s have since adapted their software to evolving technology. Say hello to the new point of sale (POS), a dynamic, multifaceted touchpoint that meets your customers where and when they're ready with convenience and personalization.

<p>Most businesses will want a card machine and a receipt printer. Note that a POS should not be confused with a credit card processing system A credit card processing system is a component of a point of sale system, but the POS can also handle a variety of functions beyond the processing of credit card payments. SalesVu POS takes a different approach to most POS providers. Such a capability will ensure that the bar menu updates in real-time and in accordance with inventory changes.</p>
<p>Loyalty and rewards programs will keep customers coming back time after time, and is a feature that retail POS systems can't handle. Square doubles as a credit card processor, so you won't need to integrate a third-party solution to accept payments.

<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
