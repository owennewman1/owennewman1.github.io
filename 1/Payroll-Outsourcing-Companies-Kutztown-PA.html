<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>
<p>We develop fully integrated, end-to-end retail POS and payment solutions in addition to leveraging third-party POS software modules from Poynt, Shopify POS, and QuickBooks POS, among others. It is accessible from every device and comes with tools to let you manage customers, point-of-sale, in-store, omnichannel, omnicommerce, inventory, merchandise, mobile shopping and transactions, CRM, and loyalty programs.</p>

<p>A result of cloud-based servers was that retailers could start accessing their POS system by picking up any device with internet connectivity—whether it was a laptop, desktop, tablet or smartphone—and logging into their business portal. Multichannel Customer Experience — retailers who manage online stores along with physical stores should have the option in their POS system to provide the same consistent product and pricing information to their customers, whether online or onsite.</p>

<p>A lot of general POS systems bill themselves as suitable for use in a restaurant. While the software powering a restaurant POS is the main element of a POS system, hardware is important as well.

<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock.

Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>
