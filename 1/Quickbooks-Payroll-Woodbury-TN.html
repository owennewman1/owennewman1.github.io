<p>It is well know that technology has improved our personal lives. Efficiencies in labour: Notably, the best POS systems will eliminate slow and convoluted processes, and remove time-consuming manual tasks - such as reconciling cash registers. Sales Monitoring and Reporting - Based on the sales report, the pos software produces a strong report. You can browse products online with the customers or you can take orders at the table, for example. All your floor to back-end management solutions get stored in one place for easy access.</p>

<p>Lavu utilizes advanced restaurant hardware and technology that include self-serve kiosks and digital menu boards, which make transacting and order taking quicker and more convenient. An obvious benefit of making restaurant reservations is that you know exactly how many customers you will feed and when. Timely and Accurate Reports - POS systems give you the ability to analyze sales data. A point of sale system is used to track and manage your inventory and ring up sales.</p>
