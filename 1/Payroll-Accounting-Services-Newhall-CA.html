<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. On the subject of transactions, Vend gives your customers the option of putting their favorite items on layaway or to pay for their goods via a split payment or credit they've accumulated on their customer account. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based.

Servers can not alter checks without a password, putting a stop to unapproved discounts for friends and family members, and eliminating the opportunity for theft. With most modern retail POS systems you can have instant access to sales and expense data from your stores during the business hours.</p>
<p>For old-school, on-premise systems, the cash register was the POS terminal. IPad devices provide a solution that helps eliminate order confusion, lagging service, and incomplete sales data.
