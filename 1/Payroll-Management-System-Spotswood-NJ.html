<p>Increased Employee Customer Interaction: Because POS systems are efficient at reducing the amount of time employees have to spend doing business operation tasks, they will have more time to spend with the customer. Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
<p>This helps you provide VIP treatment to your customers and allows your team to showcase your inventory while building customer trust. By using CAKE's employee management and basic timecards, you can clock in employees, track their breaks, and monitor overtime.

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis.

Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>A cloud-based POS system is a point of sale platform that stores information on the cloud. Retailers must adhere to specific standards when selecting POS systems, keeping in mind that the perfect marriage of POS with eCommerce is the key to running a successful retail business in the future. Better software systems allow for a variety of customer data and mailing capabilities which can identify customers by last purchase date, birthday, purchase history, customer type and salesperson.</p>
