<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business. As you can see, there are many options and features to consider when it comes to retail POS technology. With an integration to your onsite property management system from the POS, you can charge restaurant checks directly to the room for billing.</p>
