You get a large selection of floor management functions, helping you keep track of floor plans and menus. While other POS systems on the market encourage you to use your own devices, Revel strongly recommends that you buy hardware directly from them for everything to go smoothly.</p>
<p>A single POS terminal may be enough for small and new businesses, but you may want to add more if your business is busy and you need to reduce wait times. As your small business grows, so can your point of sales system. Track their hours, sales performance, overtime hours, and set special permissions for each user. It fulfills all our requirements and fits our budget, way more than I expected from a restaurant POS software.</p>
<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process.
