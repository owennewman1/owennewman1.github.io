<p>Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. Salespeople sometimes use it when they track inventory. When you log into the app, you'll notice that the overall interface is simple, intuitive and it provides smart but straightforward tools for managing customer information, generating sales reports, tracking inventory, optimizing staffing, as well as driving customer loyalty. It is easy to install and so simple to deploy that I'm embarrassed to brag about it. Truths when I say the features developed into the application are cutting edge and developed with the latest software methodologies.</p>
<p>A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. It integrates with POS systems and streamlines taking and analyzing your beverage inventory. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
