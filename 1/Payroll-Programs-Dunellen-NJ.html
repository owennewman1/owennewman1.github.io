<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>They do, however, need to concern themselves with how much their bartenders are being tipped and how easy it is for customers to leave a gratuity, especially when completing transactions via a card or wallet app. The cloud-based system was developed with scalability in mind and is suitable for all sized businesses across a range of industries, particularly hospitality, retail and services. It may also need to be integrated with property management software.</p>
<p>System is hosted online, i.e. data are stored on your POS provider's internet servers, enabling you to access it from any computer browser. The software itself requires hardware components like an iPad or tablet for android OS, cash drawers, card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, and other add-ons to offer the full point of sale experience. Hence, Inventory systems are designed so that managers can order right product at the right time, in the right quantity from the right vendor and at the right price.</p>
