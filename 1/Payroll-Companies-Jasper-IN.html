Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>

<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure. In restaurants, the ability to track ingredients in real-time and set automatic stock alerts is extremely useful, while, for retail establishments, some systems come with the ability to create your own purchase orders and track inventory across multiple locations.</p>
<p>With the right bar management software and technology, owners and operators can increase their profit margins and better understand both their business and their customers.
