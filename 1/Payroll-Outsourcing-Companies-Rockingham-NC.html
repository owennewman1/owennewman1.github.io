In June 2016, several hundred of Wendy's fast food restaurants had their POS systems hacked by an illegally installed malware.</p>
<p>If you would like to do business in-person and online, some systems will give you the ability to create an online store that will pull items from an inventory database that is exactly the same as your physical store. Used in most storefront businesses, a computer terminal combined with the POS software helps to manage everyday sales transactions and operations. This is a good pick for a quick-service or mid-size restaurant that wants tableside iPad service wrapped into a high-quality POS service.</p>
<p>Once you've examined your business requirements, it's time to start exploring which POS solutions can meet your needs.
