Manage sales, inventory and employees with ease; engage customers and increase your revenue.

Its POS system is built primarily for restaurants and other food-based businesses, though retail stores can also use it. It is affordable, has no lengthy contract requirement, is compatible with third-party POS hardware and has a good selection of features.

<p>Though they are essential to handle day to day operation in a retail store or a restaurant, they do not help generating revenue directly. Point of sales software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that allow them to track the most popular products. The intuitive nature of LAVU's system makes it easy to learn and easy to train on, and the feature-rich iPad platform makes it easy to provide five-star customer service.</p>
