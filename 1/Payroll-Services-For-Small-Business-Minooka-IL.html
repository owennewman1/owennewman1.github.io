POS Software - Again this would seem obvious, but many all-in-one POS systems simply consist of an empty hardware shell with nothing running on it. Likewise, an all-in-one printer would not scan, fax, or print without software driving features.

Sales Reporting: On the surface, most POS systems enable you to look at your sales.</p>
