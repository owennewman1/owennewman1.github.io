<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>

<h3>Friendly, Customize Payroll Software Solutions North Reading Massachusetts</h3>
<p>So, your staff at the restaurant, travel desk or any other POS outlet is always updated with the right information in real-time. Bars have unique business models, and they need POS systems that can accommodate those unique needs. For credit card processing, businesses can choose ShopKeep Payments or any processor in the BridgePay gateway including First Data, Chase Paymentech, Vantiv and Heartland. You also need magnetic stripe readers to process credit card payments.</p>
<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it. Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>But restaurant POS systems these days do much more than accept payments: They track inventory; text and email receipts; analyze customer and sales data; do invoicing; and help manage employees, among other capabilities. The POS includes a payment system, online ordering platforms, accounting systems an CRM. All of this data can help businesses to maximize profits and eliminate waste. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
