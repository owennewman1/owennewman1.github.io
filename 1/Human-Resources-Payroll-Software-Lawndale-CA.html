<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>IVend POS also helps combat in-store fraud by assigning access rights per salesperson with security, Biometric login, as well as to management of data access restrictions with password, and automatic alerts on suspicious behaviors. Most restaurant POS solutions have reporting features built-in to monitor your transactions by date, time, and type. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.</p>
<p>System is hosted online, i.e. data are stored on your POS provider's internet servers, enabling you to access it from any computer browser. The software itself requires hardware components like an iPad or tablet for android OS, cash drawers, card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, and other add-ons to offer the full point of sale experience. Hence, Inventory systems are designed so that managers can order right product at the right time, in the right quantity from the right vendor and at the right price.</p>

<p>Increased Employee Customer Interaction: Because POS systems are efficient at reducing the amount of time employees have to spend doing business operation tasks, they will have more time to spend with the customer. Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
<p>The number one reason customers get unhappy with a retail store is a long queue at the check-out. There are so many restaurants out there who offer the home delivery feature for their customers.

Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Having a POS system that can automatically track and control the inventory is a great benefit to business owners, as they can hire less stock personnel and reduce time in monitoring stock.</p>
