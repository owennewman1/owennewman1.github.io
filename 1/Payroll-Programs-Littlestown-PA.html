<p>Point of sale systems are revolutionizing the retail and hospitality industry. Enable your retail employees with a modern web and cloud point of sale system to deliver excellent customer service everywhere in the store. Detailed sales reports can be printed by region and by store or groups of staff within stores. It's crucial for your POS system to integrate easily with inventory systems, payment processing platforms, loyalty programs, reservation systems, CRM systems, shift scheduling systems, and other such tech platforms.</p>
<p>As a smaller restaurant, don't feel duped into buying the more complex POS systems. While POS software features that help streamline operations are essential, both hardware and software should be designed with efficiency, effectiveness, and ease-of-use in mind. If you are a retail business that needs more than just a light-weight cloud POS system, POSIM is right for you.

<p>Managing inventory is said to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive task in the retail business process. Retail businesses can use the system for both stationary and mobile devices. The POS hardware costs include tablets, monitors, card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, and self- service kiosks. As long as you don't need to run any in-person transactions, a point of sale system that works online—with customers inputting their card info in order to pay for your business's product or services—could be all you need.</p>

<p>Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>Manage staffing needs, menus, marketing campaigns, inventories proactively. If you own a store or shop of any genre, it is virtually impossible in today's competitive business world to survive without having a point of sales system in your cash terminal. To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware. Unfortunately, however, the easy-to-use software layout does not provide the advanced tools you'd need to manage a full-service restaurant.</p>

The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>
