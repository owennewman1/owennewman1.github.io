<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>If you would like to do business in-person and online, some systems will give you the ability to create an online store that will pull items from an inventory database that is exactly the same as your physical store. Used in most storefront businesses, a computer terminal combined with the POS software helps to manage everyday sales transactions and operations. This is a good pick for a quick-service or mid-size restaurant that wants tableside iPad service wrapped into a high-quality POS service.</p>
<p>With the launch of mobile payment particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals. Since 1990, we have aimed to give restaurants a competitive edge by providing simple, yet powerful restaurant management solutions, designed specifically for the industry.</p>
