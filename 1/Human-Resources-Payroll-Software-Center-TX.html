It has never been easier to take advantage of the benefits of a point of sale (POS) system designed for restaurants. Many owners and manages find that the reports generated from the POS system invaluable in the day-to-day and long term management of the business.

Track your sales, inventory, employees and customers - everything you need to know in one place. Two robust sets of tools are offered - a free Square POS for credit card processing and tracking sales, and the Square for Retail with intelligent and integrated tools purpose-built for more complex retail businesses.</p>

<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. But, make no mistake about it.
