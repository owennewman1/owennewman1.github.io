<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years. Transaction Fees - Other charges your restaurant business will possibly incur via POS systems are transaction fees for the payments you process. This is because VAT taxpayers may need to provide a certificate to the tax authorities showing that their cash management system fulfills the new requirements.</p>
<p>With it you can manage multiple store locations, send digital receipts, issue discounts, work offline, and accept credit card payments through an integration with credit card processor Vantiv (processing rates vary depending on your business). Besides quicker service, tableside makes settling bills easier for your customers. It's not all third-party integrations, of course: Within the software interface itself, ingredients can be tracked individually through the inventory management features, a floor plan display helps guide servers to the table they need when they need it, and a menu that supports photos of each meal to be included with each description.</p>
<p>With these POS solutions, restaurants not only manage staff and serve customers, but accurately monitor trends and marketing opportunities. Wasp QuickStore options range from complete POS single store systems to multi-store. This is helpful for bars because it means that your staff can service a customer's entire order in one location, even if they pay with a card; there's no back and forth between customer and cash register.</p>
