<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Intuitive inventory management and ordering tools save time and money, while dynamic scheduling tools help you ensure you have the right amount of staff in-house at all times. One cool benefit of POS software is that it can build individual profiles of all your customers and track their purchase history and shopping habits. They go above and beyond payment processing by automating all the critical management tasks, hence streamlining business operations as well as communication.</p>
<p>Such terminals are supported with various hardware components; cash registers, age verifiers, kitchen printers, barcode scanners, kitchen buzzers, and more. Springboard is a powerful, cloud-based POS software and management system for retailers. Many of the leading POS-based restaurant management systems have a combination of useful functions, melding POS with back-office and front-end features.
