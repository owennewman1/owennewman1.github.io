<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>Not only this, customers can avail the software's loyalty features to collect points and redeem these when needed. The POS System is hardware which is combined with POS software and peripheral devices. Additionally, the staff will have an easy time locating the various tabs whenever they need to close them. It is used by various types of retail businesses selling different products like mobile devices, clothing, beauty, cosmetics, books, sports apparel, and even groceries.</p>
<p>Cloud-based systems can greatly reduce the upfront costs of implementing a POS system for many businesses. So, of course, you should expect Square for Restaurants to provide some of the best payment handling features for restaurant POS systems.

POS hardware can be a stationary terminal or a mobile device, such as a tablet or iPad. For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards.</p>
