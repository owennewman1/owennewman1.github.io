Considering all that, it's not hard to see why pos terminals can be found in restaurants, hotels, bars, shops, stores, malls.

TouchBistro is one of the few restaurant POS systems that have not only perfected the basic POS functionalities, but also gone beyond them to offer exclusive, out-of-the-box extras.</p>
