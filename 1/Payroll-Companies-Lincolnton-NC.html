<p>If you are processing a layaway, you have to remove the merchandise from the floor yourself, because POS does not remove it from inventory until you actually sell it, and another sales associate may think you still have the item in stock.

Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
