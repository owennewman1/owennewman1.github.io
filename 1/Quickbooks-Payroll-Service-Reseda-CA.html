<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. Lavu is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as an intelligent combination of cloud computing, wireless technologies, and a sleek touchscreen interface for restaurant. Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>
<p>Other businesses who launched pre-2000s have since adapted their software to evolving technology. Say hello to the new point of sale (POS), a dynamic, multifaceted touchpoint that meets your customers where and when they're ready with convenience and personalization. Oracle MICROS for Restaurants is the POS solution from the Oracle Corporation, the parent company of NetSuite. Beyond processing transactions, it has reporting and inventory management features and provides access to a variety of integrations that can help you run your business, save time and boost sales.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems are still comprised of hardware and software components but include many new functions too. To help you minimize lost sales due to out of stocks, use replenishment capabilities in Retail Pro. You can accept payments directly by swiping and inserting the customer's cards, scanning checks, and accepting gift cards right on your POS system. A POS system comprises both POS hardware and software. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more.</p>

As the store plays a larger role, it's time for point of sale (POS) to expand its role, too. These provide retailers with tools ranging from order management and inventory tracking to customer management and payment processing for more seamless transactions.</p>
