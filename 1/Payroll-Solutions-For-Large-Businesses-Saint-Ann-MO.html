<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
