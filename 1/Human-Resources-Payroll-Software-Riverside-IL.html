You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>

Mobile technology has untethered the payment process from the traditional register, turning the entire store into a POS via tablets and other devices.</p>

<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure.

<p>Point of Sale Security : Using restaurant POS software, all employees are accountable for any sales rung up on their personal ID. Servers can not alter checks without a password, putting a stop to unapproved discounts for friends and family members, and eliminating the opportunity for theft. With most modern retail POS systems you can have instant access to sales and expense data from your stores during the business hours.</p>

With inventory management, you can change menu details, like name, quantity, and price, in real-time.</p>
<p>Amazon's concept convenience store, Amazon Go, which deploys technologies that let shoppers come in, grab items, and walk out without going through a register, could revolutionize POS systems. Your bar customer is paying the same amount as a customer in the restaurant. This refers to multiple retail outlets spread across a geographical region that has centralized management with a common brand name, business module, process, and arrangement.</p>

<p>Obviously, you need to consider the cost of the POS system (including the hardware and software). Utilizing features like inventory management will help you find where to cut food costs and to boost profit margins by using recipe costing. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs. Manage multiple locations and sales channels in real time, from any compatible device, including products, customers, and staff.</p>
<p>Modern POS systems can double as employee management tools, letting you do things like set individual user permissions and generate reports to see who is making the most sales, who is bringing in the most tips, who is comping the most drinks, etc. Speedier service and increased revenues become a reality with the Digital Restaurant Menu. Additionally, remote servers can connect to store networks and monitor sales and other store data.</p>
<p>Though they are essential to handle day to day operation in a retail store or a restaurant, they do not help generating revenue directly. Point of sales software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that allow them to track the most popular products. The intuitive nature of LAVU's system makes it easy to learn and easy to train on, and the feature-rich iPad platform makes it easy to provide five-star customer service.</p>
