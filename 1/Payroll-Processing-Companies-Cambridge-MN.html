In fact, cash register in a retail store plays a vital role in keeping track of sales, inventory etc. Most point of sale companies offer retail POS system bundles that include essential hardware components in different variations.

You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen.

For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards.</p>

<p>You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?"
