Our Retail POS software provides wide-ranging product research abilities as well as real-time usage of Inventory data all through your retail chain, that can help generate sales and profits when fulfilling the client. Superior inventory management : Managing a bar isn't only about the action that takes place in front but also about managing the backstage work.</p>
<p>As a smaller restaurant, don't feel duped into buying the more complex POS systems. While POS software features that help streamline operations are essential, both hardware and software should be designed with efficiency, effectiveness, and ease-of-use in mind. If you are a retail business that needs more than just a light-weight cloud POS system, POSIM is right for you. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>
<p>We know how many hats business owners wear each day and created an ePOS software and eCommerce system that simply works well and works right, while enabling a competitive advantage. Inventory management — Linking back-of-house and front-of-house functions is crucial, and many restaurant POS systems include inventory management features that allow you to be on top of sourcing and purchasing. Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store.</p>

<p>Firstly, CAKE caters to full-service and quick-service restaurants, pubs, bars, and other food businesses.

For credit card processing, businesses can choose ShopKeep Payments or any processor in the BridgePay gateway including First Data, Chase Paymentech, Vantiv and Heartland. You also need magnetic stripe readers to process credit card payments.</p>
<p>Square is a common favorite of mobile businesses like food trucks and boutique retail shops. These features include the ability for customers to use two types of payment, for example, or to allow for returns, special pricing (for sales or special customers), gift cards, and surge pricing. There are many different types of point-of-sale systems for each kind of business, so we've outlined some key points to consider as you shop.</p>

In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
