<p>Point of sale systems are revolutionizing the retail and hospitality industry. Enable your retail employees with a modern web and cloud point of sale system to deliver excellent customer service everywhere in the store. Detailed sales reports can be printed by region and by store or groups of staff within stores. It's crucial for your POS system to integrate easily with inventory systems, payment processing platforms, loyalty programs, reservation systems, CRM systems, shift scheduling systems, and other such tech platforms.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Cloud-based POS systems allow you to access your sales from anywhere through any mobile devices. A standard Revel POS terminal includes an iPad, payment device, POS stand, router, Wi-Fi access point, POS printer and a secure cash drawer.
