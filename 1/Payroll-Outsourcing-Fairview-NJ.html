<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. As the data are instantly available and input into your retail POS accounting back office software, you can now spot trends as they happen, not after they are long gone. Each day restaurants handle large volumes of cash and credit card transactions, making a POS system necessary. In this article, let's take a look at the ten best restaurant management software that are currently quite popular in the market.</p>
<p>The highly functional software ensures better table and menu management, inventory management, and portable operations with portable app reporting. It can make a real difference to how much time you spend on processing sales, replenishing stock and even training your staff. The software in some systems runs only for a limited period of time. With POS software, restaurant managers and owners can meet many of their practical business needs, from managing daily service all the way up to high-level analytics.</p>

<p>That means, retail merchants can easily find out the availability of items that their customers look for in every store they own. Its use is no longer restricted to the retail stores in developed countries or multi national retail stores. No matter how crazy your day gets, your restaurant point of sale will always keep you in control and help your staff stay efficient. Square for Restaurants does not provide advanced restaurant POS system features.</p>

The FoodEngine POS which has promised results for many restaurants comes in two licenses — Perpetual (both Annual and Monthly premiums) and SaaS (only Monthly Premium). You can process payments on your store's floor (especially useful for cutting down lines at the register during busy seasons), at an expo, or at an outdoor pop-up shop.</p>
<p>In addition to its Point of Sale module, the solution also offers integrated Inventory Management, Customer Management, and Retail Accounting, including general ledger, purchase orders, and payroll processing.

Silverware is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as cloud-based solutions and real time web-based reporting.
