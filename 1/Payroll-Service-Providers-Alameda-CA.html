<p>Point of sale systems are revolutionizing the retail and hospitality industry. Enable your retail employees with a modern web and cloud point of sale system to deliver excellent customer service everywhere in the store. Detailed sales reports can be printed by region and by store or groups of staff within stores. It's crucial for your POS system to integrate easily with inventory systems, payment processing platforms, loyalty programs, reservation systems, CRM systems, shift scheduling systems, and other such tech platforms.</p>
<p>From inventory tracking to detailed reports and integrations with other business management tools, point of sale software should adapt to your business needs — not the other way around. Suitable for omni-channel retailers and wholesalers, Cin7 integrates cloud inventory, Point of Sale, warehouse management, B2B ecommerce, 3PL, and direct EDI, in one robust platform.

Inventory management — Linking back-of-house and front-of-house functions is crucial, and many restaurant POS systems include inventory management features that allow you to be on top of sourcing and purchasing. Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store.</p>
