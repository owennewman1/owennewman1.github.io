<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>The accurate records of sales and inventory will help you determine which products are selling and which are not. POS systems have three parts: software, hardware and a credit card processor. A basic ‘starter' bundle will cost around £1,795 and includes the bar POS software along with a touchscreen PC, cash drawer, receipt printer, and card reader. Besides the great point of sale features, TouchBistro offers superb remote management and a strong reporting system.</p>
<p>Retailer Lyn Evans created that kind of no-disappointment experience for their customers. Similarly, the hospital cafeteria needs to monitor sales as well so that kitchen production can be in synch with the speed and quantity at which food items are being sold. It may seem like just a minor detail or one more box you have to check while setting up your small business, but choosing a functional and affordable credit card processor can have a huge impact on your company's bottom line.</p>

<p>Credit card reader: Since the EMV payment standard went live in 2015 , secure and EMV-compliant credit card readers are a must-have. Also, you'll want to train your staff on important features like upselling, inventory management, and end of day reports, all from the POS itself.

Mistake - The POS system offering the limited payment options may turn away some customers from the products and services.</p>
<p>A cloud-based POS system is a point of sale platform that stores information on the cloud. Retailers must adhere to specific standards when selecting POS systems, keeping in mind that the perfect marriage of POS with eCommerce is the key to running a successful retail business in the future. Better software systems allow for a variety of customer data and mailing capabilities which can identify customers by last purchase date, birthday, purchase history, customer type and salesperson.</p>

In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system. Vape Shops: Although casual consumers tend to classify vape stores with tobacco shops, these two business types typically use different point of sale features.</p>
