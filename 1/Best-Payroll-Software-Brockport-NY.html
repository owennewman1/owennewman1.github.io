<p>Learn what features to look for when choosing the best bar POS system for your business. IVend Retail presents a series of seven tightly integrated software modules that bridge your eCommerce and bricks-and-mortar presence to help you exceed your customer's great omnichannel expectations. Accurate wait times reduce walk-away customers and no-shows and let diners check-in before arrival. In June 2016, several hundred of Wendy's fast food restaurants had their POS systems hacked by an illegally installed malware.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers. Each system is made to provide the most efficient and productive POS experience for you and your customers. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>

<p>Lightspeed POS and Shopify POS are great alternatives to Square, with better inventory management and sales channel integrations, respectively. It has a built-in queue capability that handles long lines without the need to take numbers; all your customers need to do is sit back until the next sales agent is available. You can process payments and retain data even when the internet is down or you don't have a connection.</p>

<p>The high-quality pos software can provide several benefits to your business. Customers additionally get mobile payment options like Samsung Pay and Apple Pay. Taking customer payments is easy with Square's credit card readers and point-of-sale mobile app, which works with most Android and Apple devices; for example, many Square users run their businesses with iPads. This history means that ACE Retail has one of the longest list of POS features in the industry.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>However, a POS system like TouchBistro is more ideal for large-scale restaurants who need advanced features like detailed reporting and forecasting. Whether you're a retail shop, grocery store, clothing store, liquor store, or anything in between, ShopKeep's #1-rated POS solution streamlines your day-to-day.
