<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. It has never been easier to take advantage of the benefits of a point of sale (POS) system designed for restaurants. Many owners and manages find that the reports generated from the POS system invaluable in the day-to-day and long term management of the business. All that they need to access the POS system remotely is a PC. These safety features are offered to give business owners peace of mind and ways to improve their businesses.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>

Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.
