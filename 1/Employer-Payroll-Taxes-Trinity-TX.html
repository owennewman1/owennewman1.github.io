<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>It used to be that as a small-business owner, you had just a few ways to accept payments from your customers. Recently purchased by Upserve, the low-cost, user-friendly Upserve caters to bars, clubs, and restaurants. The POS hardware includes an internet-enabled device that can run the POS software, plus transaction tools like a receipt printer and a cash drawer. Brick and mortar retailers are moving toward leaner systems that operate on tablets and smartphones, not complicated systems that cost thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>With the right software you would be able to simplify managing aspects, automate tedious tasks and finally efficiency and speed in customer services, which would result in a better business and increase your profits. Luckily, restaurant POS software makes it easy to create an online ordering portal with minimal effort on your part.

<p>POS systems are designed not only to serve the retail, wholesale and hospitality industries as historically is the case. Livepos has been very useful for me as they provide suitable features that help in running my stores every day.

<p>Choosing retail POS software that is cloud-based, as opposed to a local server-based, can save you money too. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on the visitor's computer or mobile device. Retail stores require different types of POS equipment. You may only need a simple system to complete business transactions, or you may require a full-service option that also monitors inventory, tracks employee tips and integrates with other applications.</p>
<p>Instead of using traditional punch cards, you can now track your customer loyalty incentives using the POS system. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions. A point of sale (POS) is a place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable. It is also seen as the preferred deployment method of many businesses owing to the low price tags that come with cloud-based tools And then there is the projected increase in the use of self-service kiosks, not only by restaurants but among retailers as well.</p>
