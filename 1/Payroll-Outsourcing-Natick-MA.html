<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility â€” keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>Interested businesses can give Quickbooks' POS a free trial and pricing is dependent on the hardware and software bundle a business opts for. Many systems let you individually track employee details, shifts, payroll, and more and then send that data to accounting software. Unified technologies are integral in this balance, offering a truer picture of your business and customers so you can discover and act on opportunities to better serve your customers.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

Cross Channel returns management- The POS returns management system accepts the cross-channel returns and assists in refunds along with replacements from any type of store location.

<p>Some POS systems cater to retailers , whereas others cater to restaurants, so be sure to look for one that fits your specific needs.

Earlier in this article, we mentioned that POS systems weren't solely based on taking payments.</p>
<p>Square is a common favorite of mobile businesses like food trucks and boutique retail shops. These features include the ability for customers to use two types of payment, for example, or to allow for returns, special pricing (for sales or special customers), gift cards, and surge pricing. There are many different types of point-of-sale systems for each kind of business, so we've outlined some key points to consider as you shop.</p>
<p>With Cake POS, you have optional choices for hardware bundles and various software or service options. POS systems help different parts of your restaurant and bar communicate with each other. Toast itself acts as the client's payment processor, and unlike many of its iOS-based competitors in the POS world, runs on Android operating systems, making it at once cheaper and more versatile. Users can accept Debit and Credit cards all within the same application while capturing valuable customer data to use later with NCR Silver's marketing dashboard.</p>

The first one is an online type of system that is connected to a central computer for credit checking and inventory updating. This allows businesses to assess what products are being sold and what products are lagging in sales. For those wanting to do more with their business, Talech POS has great advanced features.</p>
