<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the processâ€”having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores.</p>
<p>The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management. Not all POS software has this option and Managers will thank you for this.
