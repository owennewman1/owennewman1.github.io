<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Double check that the POS is able to accept chip-enabled credit and debit cards. Now whether you refer to it as a POS system or retail management system - it will do the same. And with our custom-made software, you can make sure you offer your customers the best service and gain additional customer loyalty points. While some systems can handle the POS of both restaurants and retail businesses, many systems are designed specifically to handle the demanding needs of the latter.</p>
<p>EMV is the standard that is said to provide more security than the swipe-and-sign tech we've been using for the past decade or so. The ability to "dip" these cards means additional or new hardware for which some POS systems charge a bit extra. Affordable, easy to use, feature rich, and 100% multi-lingual restaurant point of sale and store management solution. At a time when computers were becoming commonplace, POS vendors had to adapt their software to maximise its potential.</p>

Six ways Vend's point of sale system will help you grow your retail business.

<p>While Rezku may not have as many robust features as other POS software, it still gives an impressive showing. In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package. This should mean a terminal that is fast, easy to understand and quick to respond to the touch of the server, cashier or bar tender. Flexible, affordable and serviceable are the key functions that aptly describe our mPOS Point of sale software system.</p>
<p>Vend tracks every sale in real time, which allows us to view overall sales throughout the day or week.
