<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. In addition to POS services, Habortouch also offers access to online reservations, employee management systems, and a customer database. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong.

Yet, because the CRM database is integrated with the POS software, the information stored in the database is even more valuable.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
