Loyverse Free software helps us a lot because it is very simple to use and to configure and it has a nice interface — offers stats on sales and best item sold.</p>
<p>Intuitive inventory management and ordering tools save time and money, while dynamic scheduling tools help you ensure you have the right amount of staff in-house at all times. One cool benefit of POS software is that it can build individual profiles of all your customers and track their purchase history and shopping habits. They go above and beyond payment processing by automating all the critical management tasks, hence streamlining business operations as well as communication.</p>

<p>Credit card reader: Since the EMV payment standard went live in 2015 , secure and EMV-compliant credit card readers are a must-have. Also, you'll want to train your staff on important features like upselling, inventory management, and end of day reports, all from the POS itself. Mobile technology has untethered the payment process from the traditional register, turning the entire store into a POS via tablets and other devices.</p>
