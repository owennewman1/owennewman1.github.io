<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>
<p>Not all retailers have the same inventory needs or offer the same services to customers. You may think of this as a mobile register that may be moved to wherever the customers are, only that it offers more capabilities than a conventional cash register. More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more.</p>
<p>This type of software can be easily installed on your POS terminal or tablet and has a wide range of capabilities - a notable one being the ability for you to store and view your sales data online.
